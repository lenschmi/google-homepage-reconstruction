# Google Homepage Reconstruction
The first Odin Project mini-project in which I reconstructed the Google Canada homepage UI.

The project description can be found [HERE](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css). I did not complete the second part in which a search page UI was reconstructed.

Some notes:
- I positioned the elements approximately where they are located on the actual Google page, but did not worry about exact distances.
- I copied the SVG images that Google used for the microphone and magnifying glass used in the search bar. I did not change the color of the magnifying glass to gray.
- Most links and hover/focus functionality was included, but I didn't add a tool-tip for the hover over the microphone in the search bar.
