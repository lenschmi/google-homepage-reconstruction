# Google Homepage Reconstruction
The first Odin Project mini-project in which I reconstructed the Google Canada homepage UI.

The project description can be found [HERE](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css). I did not complete the second part in which a search page UI was reconstructed.

Some notes:
- I used the Google UI that loaded in Chrome when I was not logged into my Google account (specifically Version 87.0.4280.88). It looks like other browser's may resize the search bar differently and do not have the Search by voice feature (and therefore the microphone image in the search bar).
- I positioned the elements approximately where they are located on the actual Google page, but did not worry about exact distances.
- I copied the SVG images that Google used for the microphone and magnifying glass used in the search bar. I did not change the color of the magnifying glass to gray.
- Most links and hover/focus functionality was included, but I didn't add a tool-tip for the hover over the microphone in the search bar or link to app bar from the drawer icon in the top header.
